**PURPOSE:**

Create an acid-base calculator using Javascript and jQuery. The user will input three variables (pH, PaO2 and HCO3) - the calculator will then come up with the disorders.

**INSPIRATION:**

I decided to do this side-project to practice creating algorithms while learning Javascript.

**LANGUAGES:**

This calculator was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and jQuery.

**FEATURES:**

--This project is as of yet incomplete and more features might be added in the future--
--The page also includes many alerts that I have not yet removed because they provide me with information to check if the calculator is working appropriately as I plan to build on it further--

- Provide pH, PaCO2 and HCO3 values.
- The above values can be provided in US or Standard International units.
- Based on these numbers the calculator will provide a primary acid-base disorder. A secondary disorder might be suggested depending on the values.
- If a metabolic acidosis is diagnosed, the user can choose to fill in an anion gap form to differentiate between normal and high anion gap metabolic acidosis.
- For the disorders the calculator says are present, a use can click a button that will provide the more common aetiologies causing them.
- While in the results page, the user can go back and input new values on the click of a button.

**EXCLUSIONS:**

- This calculator currently does not assess oxygenation and respiratory status
- Does not account for hypoalbuminaemia in calculating anion gaps
- Compensation is calculated mathematically whereas most clinicians would use a *gross trend* approach.
